  "description": "Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.  At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well. <p align=\"center\">   <img src=\"g3doc/img/kites_detections_output.jpg\" width=676 height=450> </p> Contributions to the codebase are welcome and we would love to hear back from you if you find this API useful.  Finally if you use the Tensorflow Object Detection API for a research publication, please consider citing:",
